                <p>I'm a former design project manager from London, now turned developer living in Stockholm.</p>
                <p>I am interested in all aspects of design (especially good UX and UI), passionate about music, and an appreciator of food (of course).</p>
                <p>I decided to pursue a career as a developer after seeing the exciting online experiences many brands were creating in response to changing customer behaviours.</p>
                <p>Working as a developer allows me to create meaningful online experiences and respond to problems with creative solutions.</p>
            </div>
